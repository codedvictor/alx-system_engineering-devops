Postmortem: Web Stack Outage on October 10, 2023

Issue Summary:

Duration of Outage: October 10, 2023, 14:00 - 16:30 (UTC)
Impact: An outage affecting our e-commerce platform, resulting in a 30% drop in user activity and a degraded shopping experience.
Timeline:

14:00 (UTC): Issue Detected - Customer Complaints: Customers reported slow page loading times and unresponsive shopping carts.
14:05 (UTC): Engineering Response: The incident was confirmed, and the engineering team initiated the investigation.
14:15 (UTC): Investigated Frontend: Initial assumption pointed towards frontend issues. Frontend code and CDN configurations were examined for performance bottlenecks.
14:45 (UTC): No Improvement: Despite optimizations, the problem persisted, and the root cause remained elusive.
15:00 (UTC): Escalation: The incident was escalated to the DevOps and Database teams as the problem appeared to be related to the backend infrastructure.
15:15 (UTC): Database Investigation: DevOps and Database teams examined the database servers for potential issues, but no anomalies were found.
15:30 (UTC): Misleading Path: Focusing on the database, the investigation led to false leads and consumed significant time.
15:45 (UTC): Further Escalation: The incident was escalated to the senior engineers and management as it became clear that the problem was more complex than initially thought.
16:00 (UTC): Root Cause Discovered: A network misconfiguration within the load balancer was identified as the root cause, affecting the routing of traffic to the application servers.
16:15 (UTC): Issue Resolution: Engineers reconfigured the load balancer to rectify the misconfiguration.
16:30 (UTC): Service Restored: The e-commerce platform returned to normal functionality, and the shopping experience improved significantly.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the load balancer. It resulted in improper routing of incoming traffic to the application servers, leading to excessive load on some servers and sluggish performance.

Resolution: The issue was resolved by reconfiguring the load balancer to distribute traffic evenly across all application servers, eliminating the performance bottleneck.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To Improve/Fix:

Enhanced Monitoring: Implement comprehensive monitoring solutions to detect network and load balancer misconfigurations promptly.
Documentation Update: Improve documentation for the network infrastructure and load balancer configurations to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.
Redundancy: Implement failover mechanisms in the load balancer to minimize downtime during configuration changes.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Reconfigure Load Balancer: Ensure proper load balancing configurations are set up and tested thoroughly.
Review Incident Escalation: Evaluate the incident escalation process to improve response time.
Regular Load Testing: Implement regular load testing to identify performance bottlenecks before they impact customers.
Team Training: Provide training for engineers on network infrastructure and load balancer management.
This postmortem highlights the importance of swiftly identifying and addressing root causes. The incident, though unfortunate, offers valuable lessons to enhance the reliability and performance of our web stack.

By addressing these corrective measures and implementing preventative actions, we aim to create a more robust and resilient web stack, ensuring a seamless shopping experience for our users.
